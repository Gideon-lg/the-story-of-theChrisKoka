        <p>The month of May marked a significant milestone for me: one year as a Senior Product Manager at Irembo, where I have had the privilege of leading IremboPay, Irembo’s payment gateway. Reflecting on this journey, I realize how much I have grown both professionally and personally. From diving into the world of fintech to relocating to Rwanda, the past year has been an amazing journey and adventure filled with lots of learning and growth.</p>
        <h2>Relocating To Rwanda: A New Chapter</h2>
        <p>
            Relocating to Rwanda was a big decision that brought a mix of excitement and apprehension. Moving from West Africa to East Africa! From spices &amp;pepper to zero spices &amp;zero pepper! From heat to cold! From fufu to ugali! From <strong>jollof to pilau! </strong>
            Moving to a new country always comes with its challenges, but Rwanda quickly felt like home. The turning point came when a colleague saw me enjoying Rwandan food with a smile. It was a stark contrast to how I felt when I first arrived. <strong>That’s when it hit me; my taste buds had finally adjusted to the zero-spice Rwandan cuisine!</strong>
            My transition was smoother and more enriching than I could have imagined.
        </p>
        <p>Intrigued by my move to Rwanda? We will get to that later! For now, let’s dive into my reflections on product management in the past year.</p>
        <h2>Embracing Fintech &amp;Enterprise Product Management</h2>
        <p>Transitioning to fintech is one thing and transitioning to enterprise product management is another thing and here I was, doing both at the same time! Good Jesus!</p>
        <p>
            <span  class="l oe of og bo ol ed">T</span>
            <strong>he fintech learning curve</strong>
            was a lot! I found myself learning new things like payouts, invoices, settlements, transit account, escrow account, settlement flow, T-2, T+1, principal accounts, pricing rules, merchants, payment account identifiers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a newcomer to the fintech space, I knew I needed a strong foundation to excel in my new role. Thankfully, I had the opportunity to connect with exceptional mentors, <a class="af om" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-abbey-24695b6b/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Alex Abbey</a>

            Taking the time to learn from these mentors proved invaluable during my probation period. It laid the foundation for me to understand the importance of <strong>product and organizational knowledge!</strong>

            <p>
                <strong>Reflection 1 — The Power Of Mentorship: </strong>

            <strong>mbracing enterprise product management </strong>
            was another learning curve. I am grateful to my manager at Irembo for helping me on this journey. During one of our 1:1s, he explained the differences and challenges between enterprise products and consumer products. He highlighted approaching product management from the enterprise perspective as I had the tendency of approaching it from the consumer perspective. He recommended <em>“Building Products For The Enterprise” by Reeves &amp;Gaines </em>
            which was a game-changer to the way I approached product management.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                <em>Let me briefly touch on enterprise product management.</em>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Reeves &amp;Gaines, there are three big elements that make product management in enterprise software different: <em>“our business model, our specialization, and the split between our customers and users.” </em>
            Enterprise product management involves your company building products for other enterprises or organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The business model</em>
            operates almost exclusively on a direct-sales mode and relies on direct sales to sell complicated products and solutions to a relatively small (compared to consumer software) group of sophisticated customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enterprise software is also very <em>specialized</em>
            and tailored to serving a specific technical or business need. Think <a  href="https://www.bamboohr.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">BambooHR</a>
            , tailored to meet the needs of human resource departments in organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In enterprise product management, your <strong>customers</strong>
            are the organizations that pay for your product while your <strong>users </strong>
            are the people within the organizations that use your product.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Your users</strong>
            work directly with your product to perform some function that allows them to do their jobs better, more easily, or efficiently while <strong>your customers,</strong>
            by contrast, are nearly always those users’ bosses (or their bosses, or even their bosses’ bosses) who write the cheque and the goal is to make sure that your customers <em>(the cheque writers)</em>
            are <strong>happy!</strong>
        </p>

                <strong >Reflection 2 — Moving Fast vs Building Right :</strong>
                One key thing I learned from Reeves &amp;Gaines <em class="fq">was</em>
                <strong>
                    <em class="fq"></em>
                </strong>
                <em class="fq">“move fast and break things is a recipe for disaster in enterprise software.”</em>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            With consumer software, it is all about speed, but with enterprise, the focus is more on <strong>building the right product and building it right, </strong>
            and this takes time.

            <strong>Emotions Outside The Window!</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The journey with the team has also been an amazing one. I thought I was a patient soul, but boy! I had to learn to keep my <em class="me">emotions outside the window!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am grateful to my colleagues for teaching me <strong>patience! </strong>
            Brainstorming sessions were very emotional and it was during my 1:1 with a colleague that we discussed the importance of putting emotions aside and always focusing on what’s best for the product and the company.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blair &amp;Reeves, in their book, emphasize that you make the best decision for the product by constantly asking yourself; <em class="me">“is this the best decision for the product?” </em>
            This makes all the difference in the way the product manager approaches problems and solutions.
        </p>
