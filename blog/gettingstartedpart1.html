            <em >&quot;In life, there are </em>

                <em >winners, losers &amp; people who do not know how to win. </em>
            </strong>
            <em>Getting into the tech industry can be confusing and frustrating. I have people reaching out to me on how to enter into tech. I will share my knowledge on what I know so far that has helped over time. Happy Learning. I’m here to help the latter — those of us who do not know how to win.&quot; </em>

            Navigating the tech industry can be really frustrating! I usually have a lot of people reaching out to me and saying, <em>“Richmond, I want to learn IT, programming, coding etc…” </em>
            Now the question is <strong>“Where do I start from?”</strong>
        </p>
        <h1>Step 1: Begin With The End In Mind</h1>
        <p>
            If you have read Stephen Covey’s book on 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People, you would have come across the second habit of highly effective people! <strong>Begin With The End In Mind. </strong>
            I strongly believe that, before one can build a career in the tech industry, you really need to research and have a fair idea of what you want to do should you enter the industry.
        </p>

        <p >I am super grateful to my first team lead, Eva Mwangi for giving me this perspective during my early days as a Data Scientist at getINNOtized. When I first joined the Data Science team of which she was the lead, my first task was to research the job descriptions and skill sets of the various careers in Data Science, ie data science, analytics, engineering and machine learning. The objective of this task was to make me aware of the expectations of the role I was entering and what was needed and comparing it to what I had and what I lacked.</p>

            So yes, the first step is <strong class="li fr">begin with the end in mind</strong>
            .. <br/>Ask yourself the following questions.
        </p>
        <ul class="">
            <li>Why do I want to enter into tech?</li>
            <li>What exactly do I want to do? (Data Science, Software Engineering — [FrontEnd,BackEnd, QA, FullStack], Product Management, Engineering Managment, UI/UX Development, etc)</li>
            <li>What are the expectations of these roles? (Check out job descriptions and skills needed for your desired role and note them down)</li>
            <li>
                Based on what I have found, <em>What do I have? What do I lack? Where do I need to improve?</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For me, these are key in helping you build your career path. Trust me, the tech industry is HUGEEEEE!!! A lot of careers, but you need to know what exactly you want!<strong>You need to spend time researching on exactly what you want!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>What excites you about tech? What innate abilities do you have that you can leverage on to help you in tech? If you love leading,planning, thinking, products and people, you might start thinking of Product Management &amp;Engineering Management. — (That’s my new passion in this industry!)</p>

        <h1>Step 2: Start Learning! Like Practical Learning!</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p
                <em class="oz">“The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.”</em>
                — Walt Disney
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Now that you know what you want, you’re already half-way through your journey into building a career in tech… Ops! I meant quarter-way through your journey!</p>
        <p>Oh yes! This industry is hot, fast-paced and involves a lot of learning, daily learning, continuous learning. So the earlier you start learning the better. The problem is, most of us want to enter the industry without learning, it doesn’t work that way. Spend time learning and building yourself.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Private Victory Precedes Public Victory” — 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yes! So get started reading, coding, coding, finishing online courses, watch youtube videos on anything tech etc..</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p id=>
                <em class="oz">“Success seems to be connected with action. Successful people keep moving. They make mistakes, but they don’t quit.”</em>
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>Action! Action! Action!</p>
        <p>Like I said at the beginning, getting into tech can be frustrating, but if you spend time to know exactly what you want to do (you may not really know what you want to do, but you may at least have a fair idea of what you want to do), and getting started on learning, you are already on your way to building a successful career in tech.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“The Journey Is The Reward “— Someone.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Thank you so much for reading through to the end! I will be happy to hear how you got into tech if you’re already in one, and if you are not in one, let me know if this helped.</p>
        <p>
            PS: I will do about two or three more episodes before I conclude this series, <strong>Building A Successful Tech Career.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Cheers &amp; I hope you learn from it.</p>
